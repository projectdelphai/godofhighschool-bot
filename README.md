godofhighschool-bot
================

Description
--------------
A simple reddit bot that works with the [/r/godofhighschool](http://www.reddit.com/r/godofhighschool) subreddit. It grabs the latest godofhighschool scan and raw and then posts the necessary information to the subreddit for the weekly releases.

Installation/Development Info
--------------
It is hosted on heroku and requires a password which is set as an environment variable. To work with this repo, you'll need to create a subreddit similar to /r/godofhighschool and create your own account to use, rather than the bot used here.

 1. beautiful soup 4
